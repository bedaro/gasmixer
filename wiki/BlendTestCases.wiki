= Introduction =

Gas Mixer's blending algorithm is intelligent enough to handle any trimix blending situation. The following contrived cases illustrate what you can see when blending:

= The Impossible Task =

Ask for a mix that has 21% O2, 0% He, begin with 0psi/0bar, and set the top-up gas to 32% O2. It is impossible to generate the desired mix under these constraints, and the app will tell you this.

These situations almost always arise because your top-up gas is set to something strange, so the app reminds you to confirm it's set properly.

= Wasted Gas: Too Much Nitrogen =

Ask for a mix to 3000psi/207bar of 18/40, but start with 2000psi/137bar of 24% O2. Top-up gas should be air. This is not possible because there's too much nitrogen in the cylinder already. Gas Mixer will tell you to drain the cylinder to about 1700psi/117bar, then add oxygen and helium.

= Wasted Gas: Too Much Oxygen =

This is a similar situation to the above excess nitrogen scenario. Ask for a mix to 3000psi/207bar of 18/40, starting with 2000psi/137bar of 32% O2. Top-up gas should again be air. In this case there is too much oxygen in the cylinder already, so Gas Mixer will tell you to drain some of the contents, then add helium and top up with a little air.
