=Introduction=

Scuba Tanks is an app I wrote to handle storage of cylinder sizes the user has available for blending. It contains two publicly accessible API's for other apps, both of which are used by Gas Mixer:
  # An Intent to select a cylinder size from the app's database of sizes
  # A Content Provider to query information on cylinder sizes directly
