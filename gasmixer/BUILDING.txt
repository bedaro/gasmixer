Building Gas Mixer from source requires a basic working knowledge of
compiling Java projects on your system and using a command line (DOS or Unix).

Dependencies
------------
You will need the following software tools to build Gas Mixer:
- A JDK compatible with Java 1.6 or later and the Android Tools (Oracle,
  OpenJDK, Blackdown, etc.)
- Google Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk)
- Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)

Code Dependencies
-----------------
Gas Mixer requires two external libraries to build:
- scubalib
- android_common
- scuba tanks

The source for the first two of these can be found in my andDive project's SVN
repository:
http://code.google.com/p/anddive
Scuba Tanks can be found at http://code.google.com/p/gasmixer

For scubalib, see the build instructions to produce a .jar of each in the
"bin" directory. Then either copy or symlink that jar into the "libs"
directory of Gas Mixer.
android_common is an Android library that gets included differently. You will
need to check out the source, then create a file "build.properties" in Gas
Mixer containing an entry that points to your working copy of android_common.
For instance, if you had checked out android_common to
"/home/me/dev/android_common", you would use the following:

	android.library.reference.1=/home/me/dev/android_common

If you put android_common in the same directory as the Gas Mixer project, you
will not need to manually specify its location.

android_common has its own build requirements; make sure to read its build
instructions. You can test building android_common on its own before trying
to build Gas Mixer and a simpler test of your build environment.

See Scuba Tanks for build instructions. You must compile the
"CylinderORMapper.jar" file and copy or symlink it to the "libs" directory of
Gas Mixer.

Building
--------
Once your environment is set up, you can use the standard Ant commands to
compile the project. On a command line in the top-level Gas Mixer directory,
type "ant" to see the details. For more information, see
