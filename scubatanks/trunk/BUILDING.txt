Building Scuba Tanks from source requires a basic working knowledge of
compiling Java projects on your system and using a command line (DOS or Unix).

Dependencies
------------
You will need the following software tools to build Gas Mixer:
- A JDK compatible with Java 1.6 or later and the Android Tools (Oracle,
  OpenJDK, Blackdown, etc.)
- Google Android SDK (http://developer.android.com/sdk)
- Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org)

Code Dependencies
-----------------
Scuba Tanks requires three external libraries to build:
- scubalib
- Core
- android_common

The source for all of these can be found in my andDive project's SVN
repository:
http://code.google.com/p/anddive

For scubalib, see the build instructions to produce a .jar of each in the
"build" directory. Then either copy or symlink that jar into the "libs"
directory of Scuba Tanks.
android_common is an Android library that gets included differently. You will
need to check out the source, then create a file "build.properties" in Scuba
Tanks containing an entry that points to your working copy of android_common.
For instance, if you had checked out android_common to
"/home/me/dev/android_common", you would use the following:

	android.library.reference.1=/home/me/dev/android_common

If you put android_common in the same directory as the Scuba Tanks project, you
will not need to manually specify its location.

android_common has its own build requirements; make sure to read its build
instructions. You can test building android_common on its own before trying
to build Scuba Tanks and a simpler test of your build environment.

Building
--------
Once your environment is set up, you can use the standard Ant commands to
compile the project. On a command line in the top-level Gas Mixer directory,
type "ant" to see the details. For more information, see
http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/building/building-cmdline.html

There is one custom Ant task on this project: "ormapper-jar". This task
creates a JAR file containing the CylinderORMapper class, which is needed to
build third-party apps that use Scuba Tanks data.
